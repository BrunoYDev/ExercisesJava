# Welcome to My Java Practice Repository!

Welcome! This repository is my personal collection of studies and hands-on exercises in the Java programming language. It serves as a practical journal of my learning journey, from the core fundamentals to more specific concepts.

Feel free to browse through the code. Whether you're a fellow student, an experienced developer, or just curious about Java, I hope you find something useful or interesting here.

## About This Repository

The primary goal here is to document my progress and create a personal library of Java code snippets and solutions. The exercises cover a range of topics, including:

-   **Java Fundamentals:** Basic syntax, data types, operators, and control flow.
-   **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):** Key concepts like classes, objects, inheritance, and polymorphism.
-   **Core APIs:** Working with strings, collections, loops, and other essential Java features.

As I continue to learn, I'll be adding more exercises covering new and advanced topics.

## How to Use

All the exercises are located within the `src` directory. Each `.java` file is named according to the concept it demonstrates (e.g., `Concatenation.java`, `Loops.java`, etc.), making it easy to find what you're looking for.

### Prerequisites

To compile and run these exercises on your local machine, you will need:

-   **Java Development Kit (JDK):** Make sure you have a recent version of the JDK installed.
-   **An IDE or Text Editor:** You can use any Java-supporting IDE like IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or VS Code. You can also compile and run directly from the command line.

### Running the Code

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/BrunoYDev/ExercisesJava.git
    ```

2.  **Navigate to the source directory:**
    ```bash
    cd ExercisesJava/src/com/exercisesjava/
    ```

3.  **Select wich package do you like to test: **
    ```bash
    cd ExercisesJava/src/com/exercisesjava/basicconcepts
    ```

4.  **Compile and run a specific Java file:**
    For example, to run an exercise named `ConcatExercise.java`:
    ```bash
    # Compile the code
    javac ConcatExercise.java

    # Run the compiled program
    java ConcatExercise
    ```
All the exercises are commented, please uncommented the respective exercise to execute.
